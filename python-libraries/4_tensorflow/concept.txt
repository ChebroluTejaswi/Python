Tensorflow is based on Python Programming language and performs numerical computations using data flow graphs to build models

Features:
1. Works efficiently with multidimensional arrays
2. Provides scalability of computation across machines and large datasets
3. Supports fast debugging and model building
4. Has large community and provides TensorBoard to visualize the model.

Applications:
1. Face detection
2. Language translation
3. Fraud detection
4. Video detection


Tensor is a vector or a matrix of n-dimensions that represents all types of data. Defined by a unit of dimensionality called as rank.
Scalar: 2                   rank:0
Vector: [1 2]               rank:1
Matrix: | 1 2 |             rank:2
        | 3 4 |
Tensor: | [1  2]  [3  4] |  rank:3
        | [5  6]  [7  8] |  eg: picture (x, y coordinates. Each having pixels.)

Tensorflow performs computations with the help of dataflow graphs.
It has nodes that represent the operations in your model.
Keras is a high level API in Tensorflow 2.0 (tf.keras)
Keras provides a number of model building APIs such as sequential, Functional and Subclassing, so we can choose the right level of abstraction for our project.
